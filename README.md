## Description

E-Commerce is a back-end series of linked mysql databases simulating an e-commerce company's databases. It uses sequelize, node, and dotenv to manage different categories, types of products, while simultaneously tagging them for ease of organization.

## Installation

This app requires node.js, mysql2, sequelize, express, and dotenv, and their assorted dependencies, all of which can be installed through NPM.

## Usage

After the necessary dependencies have been generated, open a new terminal and cd into the program directory. Run "npm run seed" to seed the databases with data, then "npm start" to initialize the application.

Afterwards you can issue mysql commands through the terminal (after running "mysql -u root -p") or use postman, insomnia, or a similar app to issue Get, Post, Put, or Delete commands.
